# Solarpunk Athens: Agora's Defense

![Banner Image](RiseOfAgora.png)

We're thrilled to unveil **Solarpunk Athens: Agora's Defense**, a pioneering MMO game set in a solarpunk-themed Athens, brought to life with Unreal Engine. This project transcends traditional gaming experiences by integrating advanced conversational and generative AI, along with Nerfs for photorealistic world generation (ConvAI) for NPC interactions, and a unique blend of in-game and real-world skill development.

## Why Solarpunk Athens?

The gaming realm often falls short in bridging virtual skill acquisition with real-world application. We're here to bridge that gap, offering a gaming experience that not only entertains but educates and contributes to genuine skill development.

## What's in Store?

Embark on an adventure in a solarpunk Athens, interact with ConvAI-driven NPCs, and defend the Agora servers from rogue AI hoards. Develop in-game skills like combat or diplomacy, and real-world skills like hacking, tracked through platforms like GitHub and in-game group tasks.

## Join the Adventure!

We're in the prototype development phase and have successfully integrated ConvAI. Up next is developing the skill tracking mechanism, followed by beta testing, and then a full launch in 6 months. We invite gamers, lifelong learners, and open-source contributors to join us in this exciting journey!
